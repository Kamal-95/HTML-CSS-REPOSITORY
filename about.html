<h1>About US</h1>
<p>
                    Personalization is a big deal—a really big deal
                if you are to believe all the important posts, articles, and punditry out there. 
                I would tend to agree, though I’d want to make sure that personalization is just
                one element of a larger effort to engage customers
                at the level they need to be to keep them interacting—and transacting—with my business.
